# Exercise 8: Performance testing of web app (Optional)
Duration: 30 minutes

Azure Load Testing Preview is a fully managed load-testing service that enables you to generate a high-scale load. Regardless of where your applications are hosted, the service simulates traffic for them. It can be used by programmers, testers, and quality assurance (QA) engineers to enhance the speed, scalability, or capacity of applications.

Azure Load Testing is currently in preview because of this we have limited options available as of now.

In this task, we will see how to load test the partsunlimited web application with Azure Load Testing (Preview) from the Azure portal.

1. Firstly, you will create an Azure Load Testing resource. In the Azure portal, click on the **Show portal menu (1)** and select **+Create a resource (2)**.

10. On the Quick test page, provide the following details:

   - **Test URL:** Enter **https://partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>.azurewebsites.net** **(1)**
   - Rest of the details are optional. Default values are already updated for all the tasks.
   -  Click on **Review + create (2)**. This will create and start the load test.

11. Once the load test begins, you will be directed to the test run dashboard. Azure Load Testing records both client-side and server-side metrics while the load test is underway. 

12. On the dashboard, you will see the client-side metrics in real-time while the test is running. The data refreshes every five seconds by default.
